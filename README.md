LisPy
=====

Python interpreter for Lisp.

Intended to be suitable for analysis by people new to compilers.

Usage
-----

The interpreter itself is called `lispy/lis.py`. It can be used interactively by executing the script directly or passively by passing a lisp file as an argument.

```
python lispy examples/euler001.lisp

```
